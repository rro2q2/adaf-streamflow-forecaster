# Attention-based Domain Adaptation Forecasting of Streamflow in Data Sparse Regions
This is the official repository for the ICLR 2023 workshop paper on Climate Change AI titled [Attention-based Domain Adaptation Forecasting of Streamflow in Data Sparse Regions](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climate-change-ai/papers/iclr2023/14/paper.pdf).

## Note: This repository is still under development. A completed version will be released soon.

## Prerequisites
### Neuralhydrology Project
The Python enviroment that uses transfer learning for hydrological time series modeling for streamflow basins is based on [Neuralhydrology GitHub](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology) repository. In order to run the experiments, you will need to first follow the instillation steps of the following links. For installation purposes, you will need to do a "Non-Editable" installation in your Python environment, as this will allow you to add the model and dataset we have included. Please stop when you reach "Training the Model" in the [Neuralhydrology Documentation](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io) link. Please see the following links below for installing the Neuralhydrology repoository:

- Neuralhydrology Repo: [neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology) 
- Neuralhydrology Documentation: [neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io](https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io)

### Package Requirements TODO
- Python: 3.8+
- We recommend to use Anaconda/Miniconda. With one of the two installed, a dedicated environment with all requirements will be added to the project

### Hardware Requirements
For improving model training and evaluation, we recommend using a multiple GPU cores. The CPU cores may take a long time too training or lead to an error.
